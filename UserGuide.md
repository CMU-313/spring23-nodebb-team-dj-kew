3. Fill in the post title and description (for example post title could be "Sample Anonymous Post 2" and post description could be "post post post"

5. Furthermore, for other anonymous posts, you won't be able to see the avatars of the user making the post. For example, if other anonymous posts exist in the forum under the category "Anouncements". It would look like the following to other your currently logged-in user:
